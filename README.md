# Mirai-and-IOC
Mirai is best known for its massive cyber attack that swept both the US and Europe in 2016, which caused the largest internet blackout in US history. 

The malware created a massive botnet from IoT devices and attacked a domain system for hundreds of major websites. 

Since 2016, Mirai hasn't been silent. In April, the botnet launched IoT DDoS attacks on the finance industry; and in May, the three new attacks popped up targeting IoT devices.

The objective here is to install the Mirai botnet and document IOC (Indicators of Compromise).

I exploit different vulnerabilities and identify Indicators of Compromise and analyze the attack vector of the botnet.
